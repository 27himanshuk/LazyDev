            <p class="card-text mb-auto"><strong>The world's tallest tropical tree is 330 feet tall and weighs more than a jetliner.</strong> On the island of Borneo in Malaysia, there's one yellow meranti that's been deemed the world's tallest
              tropical tree. Weighing more than a jetliner (which is around 180,000 pounds) and standing 330 feet tall, the view from the top is almost too stunning to describe. That's what local climber Unding Jami found out when he scaled the tree
              to get the official measurement.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>Russia is so big that it's home to 11 time zones.</strong> Covering 6.6 million square miles, Russia is the largest country in the world, so it makes sense for its land to spread across multiple times zones. The country spans 11 times zones altogether, which means Russians on one end of the country could be starting their day while Russians on the other end are winding down.</p>

While only 2.4 miles apart, they sit on opposite sides of the International Date Line, and thus have a 21-hour time difference between them. This is why they are nicknamed Tomorrow and Yesterday Island.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>THE ENTIRETY OF THE WORLD’S POPULATION COULD EASILY FIT IN TEXAS.</strong> If the entire world were as densely populated as New York City, the whole population would only cover 250,404 square miles. That means the entire world could fit into the state of Texas. For comparison, if the world had the same population density as Houston, Texas, it would cover 1,769,085 square miles. Even then, being able to hypothetically fit over 7 billion people in an area smaller than half the United States is pretty impressive.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>AUSTRALIA MAY BE SURROUNDED BY WATER, BUT IT DOESN’T HAVE THE WORLD’S LONGEST COASTLINE.</strong> Being its own continent and completely surrounded by water, you’d think Australia would easily have the honor of being the country with the longest coastline. However, that title goes to Canada. Canada has 152,100 miles of coastline, compared to Australia’s measly 16,000 miles. In fact, Australia ranks seventh on the list of the world’s longest coastlines, coming in behind Indonesia, Greenland, Russia, Philippines, and Japan.</p>

The Earth is round, but not a perfect sphere, and is actually flatter at the poles with bulge around the Equator, hence the equatorial bulge. Because of its location on the equator, Mount Chimborazo is 7,000 feet higher in the sky than Mount Everest, and the Ecuadorian mountain's summit is the farthest from Earth's core than any other mountain.</p>

Sudan touts 200-255 known pyramids, built for the Kushite kingdoms of Nubia, compared to Egypt's relatively paltry 138 pyramids.</p>
