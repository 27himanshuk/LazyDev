            <p class="card-text mb-auto"><strong>The tea bag was invented by accident.</strong> Though many of us associate all things tea with the British, the portable tea bag was a purely American invention. Before 1908, tea only came in loose leaf form and needed to be steeped in a metal diffuser to brew. However, when a New York tea merchant sent out samples of his tea in small silk bags, some of his customers assumed that the bag could take the place of the diffuser—so they just dunked the whole thing in boiling water. The Brits turned up their noses at this American practice—until after World War II, when the portability factor won them over.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>The oldest known star appears to be older than the universe.</strong> An ancient star called Methuselah has baffled scientists due to the fact that the celestial body appears to be older than the actual universe. Although previous research suggested the star was around 16 billion years old, despite the universe being a mere 13.8 billion years old.
           Howard Bond, the lead author of a 2013 study by Pennsylvania State University and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, factored in information about the star's distance, brightness, composition, and structure. As a result, he explained that he measured Methuselah at "an age of 14.5 billion years, with a residual uncertainty that makes the star's age compatible with the age of the universe." That uncertainty is plus or minus 800 million years, meaning Methuselah could be around 13.7 billion years old, which would make it slightly younger than the universe. </p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>Jack Black's parents are rocket scientists.</strong> Jack Black has made a name for himself in Hollywood by playing goofy characters such as the slacker-turned-fake-substitute-teacher Dewey Finn in 2003's School of Rock and a monastery-cook-turned-Mexican-wrestler in 2006's Nacho Libre. But in real life, he's the son of rocket scientists. The actor was born on April 7, 1969, in Santa Monica, California, to Tom and Judy Black, who were both satellite engineers. His late mother, also known as Judith Love Cohen, worked on missions and projects such as the Minuteman missile, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, and the Apollo Space Program.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>A "Frankenstein" Tree Can Produce 40 Different Kinds of Fruit</strong> When Professor Van Aken found out that a nearby orchard was closing, he came up with a plan to save the many rare varieties of fruit grown on the trees. He bought the orchard, planned carefully, and began grafting various branches from different trees onto a main tree. Five years later, that main tree can now produce 40 different types of fruit. Since then, Van Aken has created 15 more "Trees of 40 Fruit"—which also blossom into multiple colors each year—across the country.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>The Inventor of the Three-Point Seatbelt Gave It Away for Free.</strong> Cars in the 1950s, if they had safety devices at all, had only lap belts, which may have actually made accidents more dangerous. Then in 1959, Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin created a three-point seat belt like the one we know today, which adds a shoulder strap to the lap belt. It was quickly apparent that this simple device was an enormous leap forward for safety. Though Volvo could have kept it proprietary, they instead followed Jonas Salk's example and opened the patent so that all car manufacturers could install the devices. This simple decision cost Volvo millions of dollars, but it has since saved millions of lives.</p>

However, it was no ordinary letter—it was an application for the director's job. Though the museum bosses recognized that Sam could hardly commit to a full-time job, what with his school schedule, they were so impressed with his love of trains that they invited him to the museum and even created a new job title especially for him: Director of Fun.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>Braille Was Invented by a Teenager.</strong> You've probably heard of Louis Braille, the man who invented a writing system of raised dots that allows blind people to read easily. However, did you know that he was only 15 when he invented it? Frustrated at the size of the existing books for the blind—consisting of full letters embossed on each page—he learned a military code language called sonography that could be read by touch and simplified it. His schoolmates picked it up quickly and soon it became the standard language in schools for the blind.</p>
