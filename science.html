            <p class="card-text mb-auto"><strong>Hot water freezes faster than cold water.</strong> This fact seems counterintuitive, but it’s called the Mpemba effect, after a Tanzanian student named Erasto Mpemba who told his teacher than a hot
              mixture of ice cream froze faster than a cold one. Scientists now believe this is because the velocities of water particles have a specific disposition while they’re hot that allows them to freeze more readily. If proven correct, this
              finding could also have implications in daily life, like cooling down electronic devices.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>But don’t worry—we have a lot of DNA.</strong> Scientists predict that there are over 3 billion base pairs of DNA in human genes and over 25,000 genes in the human genome. An entire copy of that genome exists in
              each of the 10 trillion cells in the human body. If all of that DNA were lined up, it would cover the distance between Earth and the sun 100 times.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>The human stomach can dissolve razor blades. </strong> On the rare occasion that you swallow a razor blade, don’t fret. The human body is more capable than you think. Acids are ranked on a scale from 0 to 14—the
              lower the pH level, the stronger the acid. Human stomach acid is typically 1.0 to 2.0, meaning that it has an impeccably strong pH. In a study, scientists found that the “thickened back of a single-edged blade” dissolved after two hours
              of immersion in stomach acid.</p>

              length of a day will become 25 hours…in about 175 million years.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>After a kidney transplant, you actually have three kidneys.</strong> Over 31 million people in the United States suffer from chronic kidney disease and it’s the ninth leading cause of death, making kidney
              transplants relatively common. But did you know that most of the time the surgeon doesn’t remove the diseased kidney? The doctor normally leaves the old kidney in place and puts the donor kidney in the lower belly on the front side of
              the body.</p>

              element was hydrogen. All the other followed by fusing hydrogen into helium, which then fused into carbon and so on. Approximately 73% of the mass of the visible universe is in the form of hydrogen. Helium makes up about 25% of the
              mass, and everything else represents only 2%. By mass, hydrogen and helium combined make up less than 1% of the Earth.</p>

              covered in a lot of iron oxide — these are the same compounds that give blood and rust their distinct color. In light of this, it’s no coincidence that Mars, which occasionally appears as a bright red ‘star’, was named after the Greek
              god of war.</p>
