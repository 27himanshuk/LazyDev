            <p class="card-text mb-auto"><strong>The remains of the inventor of the Pringles can are in a Pringles can.</strong> Fredric Baur was the man responsible for creating the iconic Pringles can. That's why, when he passed away in 2008, his
              children honored his wishes to be laid to rest in one. "When my dad first raised the burial idea in the 1980s, I chuckled about it," Baur's eldest son told Time. But it turned out, Baur was serious. So after his death, his children
              stopped to buy a can of Pringles while heading to the funeral. His son recalled, "My siblings and I briefly debated what flavor to use, but I said, 'Look, we need to use the original.'".</p>

              cases like this one. In 2009, a California woman sued Quaker Oats, the makers of Cap'n Crunch's Crunchberry cereal, for tricking her into believing that it contained real fruit. But the judge didn't find her case to be reasonable. The
              court ruled that, as "crunchberries" aren't real and since the box lists the ingredients, the cereal packaging wasn't deceptive. </p>
