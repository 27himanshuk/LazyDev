            <p class="card-text mb-auto"><strong>The bumblebee bat is the world's smallest mammal. </strong> At just over an inch in length and less than one ounce in weight, Kitti's hog-nosed bat, also known as the bumblebee bat, is the smallest
              mammal on the planet. As its name suggests, it has a pig-like snout for a nose, and its eyes are barely visible. These tiny creatures are found only in western Thailand and southeast Myanmar. Forest-burning practices in these areas have
              reduced the population significantly over the past few decades.</p>

              certain other whales that remain consistent over their lifespans. Just like you'd rather spend your time with your best friend or your favorite aunt, sperm whales have WFFs (whale friends forever) whom they love to hang out with.</p>

              feeding their families. "Lionesses, not male lions, do the majority of hunting for their pride while the males protect their pride."</p>

              anti-fungal properties, which can help keep wounds clean and prevent infection. It's also said that spider webs are rich in vitamin K, which helps promote clotting.</p>

              themselves). For example, orangutan Hsing Hsing from an Australian zoo has once stolen a photo of Nicole Kidman from a magazine and brought it to its home. Apparently, he liked her very much.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>Elephants can "hear" with their feet. </strong> You'd think that with those enormous ears, elephants would be able to pick up on every sound both near and far. But it turns out that to detect distant noises, the
              animals also "hear" with their feet. "Normally, they would hold their big ears out like a parabola and scan back and forth. But to detect distant noise and vocalizations, they'd freeze and lean forward and put weight on their front
              legs," Caitlin O'Connell, the Stanford University research associate who discovered the phenomenon. </p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>Penguins Propose to Their Mates. </strong> Not only do penguins mate for life, but they also have a ritual to mark the occasion. But since they can't get down on one knee, male Gentoo penguins hunt avidly for the
              smoothest, roundest pebble to present to their potential mates. If the female accepts his "proposal," she adds the pebble to her nest and the two will soon breed. So important are these pebbles that male penguins have been known to
              fight over the most perfect ones!</p>
