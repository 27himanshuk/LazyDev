        <p class="mb-auto"><strong>Before Mechanical Clocks There Were Candle Clocks.</strong>In the past, one of the most popular methods of telling the time was by using a 'candle clock' that burned fairly reliably at a set pace past defined markers that indicated the time.
             It was even possible to create a makeshift alarm by inserting a nail into the candle at the desired interval. When the wax around the nail melts, it would drop onto the metal plate below and make a noise.
             There's no certainty over when candle clocks were first used, but they are no longer in use today, having being superseded by the mechanical clock. The earliest known reference to candle clocks was by You Jiangu in 520 CE.</p>

        <p class="mb-auto"><strong>Most Ancient Gladiators Were Vegetarian</strong>When you think of a gladiator's diet, it's easy to envisage a mighty warrior messily devoring a juicy steak. The truth, it seems, is that many gladiators were actually vegetarians, eating a diet consisting of healthfoods such as beans, grains, oatmeal, and dried fruit.
                These were often washed down with a drink that consisted of vinegar and plant ash, used like a modern-day sports drink to fortify the body after physical exertion and promote bone health.
                Researchers believe that despite their meat-free diet, gladiators were well-built, muscular people who were larger than modern-day athletes, giving them extra protection from the blows.</p>

        <p class="mb-auto"><strong>In the thirteenth century, Pope Gregory IX basically declared war on the cats of the world.</strong> Gregory insisted that black cats in particular were associated with devil worship, which led to them being widely exterminated throughout Europe. Itâ€™s believed that over time the scarcity of cats allowed the rat population to grow, which in turn helped to spread the bubonic plague a few decades later!</p>
